### The 9 Building Blocks

		* They are reached through different Distribution Channels  
		* They require different types of relationships  
		* They have substantially different profitabilities  
		* They are willing to pay for different aspects of the offer
* examples:  
		* Mass market
		* Niche market
		* Segmented
		* Diversified
		* Multi-sided platforms(or multi-sided markets)  
2.  Value Propositions
*  Describe:
the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment.  
**What value do we deliver to the customer?**  
**Which one of our customer's problems are we helping to solve?**
