		* They are willing to pay for different aspects of the offer
* examples:  
		* Mass market

2.  Value Propositions

### FREE as a business model  

*  three different patterns:
		* free offer based on multi-sided platforms(advertising-based)

12. For entrepreneurs, **executives, consultants, and academics**, it is high time to understand the impact of his extraordinary evolution.  
13.  How can we turn visionary ideas into game-changing business models that challenge the establishment-or **rejuvenate** it if we ourselves are the **incumbents**?  
14.  Since practicing is better than **preaching**, we **adopted** a new model for writing this book.
15.  The challenge is that the concept must be simple, **relevant**, and **intuitively** understandable, while not oversimplifying the complexities of how enterprises function.  
16. Increasingly, companies are **utilizing** user communities to become more involved with customer/**prospects** and to **facilitate** connections between community members.  
17.  If customers comprise the heart of a business model, Revenue Streams are its **arteries**.  
18.  Each Revenue Stream may have different pricing **mechanisms**, such as fixed list prices, bargaining, **auctioning**, market dependent, volume dependent, or yield management.  
19.  A **microchip manufacturer** requires **capital-intensive** production **facilities**, whereas a microchip designer focuses more on human resources.
20.  Key resources can be owned or **leased ** by the company or **acquired** from key partners.  
21.  The former has an enormous global network o stores and related logistics **infrastructure**.   
22.  Every enterprise requires human resources, but people are particularly **prominent** in certain business models.  
23.  Some business models call for financial resources and/or financial **guarantees**, such as cash, lines of credit, or a stock option pool for hiring key employees.
24.  Ericsson may **opt** to borrow funds from banks and capital markets, then use a **portion** of the **proceeds** to provide **vendor** financing to equipment customers, thus ensuring that orders are placed with Ericsson rather than competitors.

32.  Before launching the Wii, Nintendo was **spiraling** downward, rapidly losing market share, and **teetering** on the edge of **bankruptcy**.    
33.  Thus, the Nintedo Wii was less costly to produce, allowing the company to **forego commercialization subsidies**.
